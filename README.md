## My process

To begin with, I set the HTML structure with no id nor classes. I kept all tags as semantic as possible. Then, worked on css styling. While styling, I set id and classes as needed. I style mobile first and once mobile version was all set, I added media query for larger devises and a flexbox display to rearange the elements disposition.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt to keep html code as semantic as possible. I also remember some css properties such as:

```css
h1 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

```css
@media (min-width: 768px);
```

### Continued development

I would like to keep working on media queries, as it is an area I usually left for the end on my personal projects and sometimes, regretfully I don't get to finish, so I never get there.

### Useful resources

- [Text-transform property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-transform.asp) - This helped me to remember how to set a text content all in caps.
- [Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This reminded me how to accurately write a media query on css.
